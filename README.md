#### In [Inkdrop v5.8.0](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/inkdrop-desktop-v5-8-0/) this feature was added to the core application. Therefore i have unpublished this plugin from the Inkdrop Plugin registry and archived the repository.

# Backlinks

Just a simple plugin to display backlinks in the editor drawer.

## Usage

Simply open the editor drawer and you should see a list of backlinks.

A backlink is a link to a note that links to the current note.

| Backlink Display | Link Example |
| --- | --- |	
| ![backlink display](./img/backlink-display.png) | ![link example](./img/link.png) |



## Install

```bash
ipm install backlinks
```
